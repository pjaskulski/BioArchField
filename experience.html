                        Parish church of St. Peter and St. Paul the Apostles was erected on the cliff, on the very shore
                        of the Puck Bay. Its characteristic silhouette, visible from afar, is the hallmark of Puck.

                        The exact date when the Puck parish was established is unknown, although it is believed that it
                        is one of the oldest in Pomerania. The existence
                        of the temple was confirmed by the written sources from the 13th century, and the oldest mention
                        of the parish priest comes from 1288. There are stone foundations under the pillars, which are
                        preserved remains of the oldest stone temple, recognized as a Romanesque church from the second
                        half of the 13th century. An existing defensive tower with a decorative brick frieze was added
                        to it before 1309.

                        The present church made of granite blocks and bricks was built between 1330 and 1400. The oldest
                        part, erected before 1348, forms the north wall of the church with chapels, and the remaining
                        walls, including the ‘rainbow arch’ and pillars, were built a little later, in the second half
                        of the 14th century. During the fifteenth century, a magnificent twelve-split eastern gable was
                        added, and by the end of 1496 the naves were roofed with a common roof and this original roof
                        truss can still be admired today.

                        In the history of each settlement, an important role is played by the space intended for the
                        burial of the dead. In the Middle Ages, it was usually surrounding the church. It was believed
                        that the dead should be buried in the sacred land around the temple. It was no different in the
                        case of Puck - there was a church cemetery around the parish church, and more important
                        residents were buried in its underground.

                        The archaeological excavations in Puck have a long history, starting over 30 years. Since
                        beginning the research was led by the team of archaeologists from the Department of Archaeology
                        of the Late Middle Ages and Modern Times from the Institute of Archaeology of the University of
                        Warsaw and a group of students who learnt the ropes of proper archaeological conduct here. This
                        allows for undertaking various research problems, systematic collection of research results and
                        gradual, extensive reconstruction of the town's history and material culture. The results of
                        both excavation and further analysis have been published in five scientific monographs,
                        describing various aspects of the city's past as well as dozens of bachelor's and master's
                        theses.

                    <p class="lead">
                        During the first years, excavations focused on the castle grounds, barely readable today in
                        the northern part of the old town. They brought forward understanding of the original
                        structure of a small administrative castle, built by the Teutonic Knights at the turn of the
                        14th and 15th centuries, located on a small hill above the bay waters.

                            In subsequent years, excavations gradually covered the town area, providing new data for
                            understanding the creation and development of early medieval settlement – from the service
                            village from the 12th and 13th centuries to the recognition of layout and functioning of the
                            later town and the adjacent village. The area of the market square, existing since Middle
                            Ages,
                            was also excavated, uncovering in its centre the remains of the oldest Puck town hall
                            erected
                            before 1400. The latest discoveries related to the settlement in the area at the turn of the
                            BCE/CE and the camp of Mesolithic hunters from around 6,000 years ago allows us to reach
